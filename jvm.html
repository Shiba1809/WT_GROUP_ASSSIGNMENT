	<h1><u><i><font color="brown">JDK, JRE, and JVM</font></i></u></h1>
    <h2><u><i><font color="brown">JVM</font></i></u></h2>
<p>The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a software program that executes Java bytecode.
     It is the cornerstone of the Java platform and is responsible for running Java applications.
      The JVM translates Java bytecode into machine code that can be executed on a computer's processor.</p>

<h2><u><i><font color="brown">JDK</font></i></u></h2>
<p>The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit that includes tools for developing and testing
     Java applications. It contains the JVM, as well as the Java compiler, libraries, and other tools needed for 
     developing Java applications.</p>

<h2><u><i><font color="brown">JRE</font></i></u></h2>
<p>The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software environment that provides the minimum requirements for running
     Java applications. It includes the JVM and a set of standard class libraries. The JRE is designed for end-users
      who want to run Java applications on their computers, but do not need the tools provided by the JDK.</p>

<h2><u><i><font color="brown">JDK vs. JRE</font></i></u></h2>
<p>The main difference between the JDK and JRE is that the JDK includes development tools, while the JRE does not.
     If you are developing Java applications, you will need the JDK. If you only need to run Java applications,
      the JRE will suffice.</p>

<h2><u><i><font color="brown">Conclusion</font></i></u></h2>
<p>The JVM, JDK, and JRE are essential components of the Java platform. The JVM provides a consistent environment
     for Java applications across different platforms. The JDK includes tools for developing and testing 
     Java applications, while the JRE provides the minimum requirements for running Java applications.</p>
